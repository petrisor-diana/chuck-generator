# Chuck Generator 

A **practice app** for all of you that have just started learning Front-End Development. But, unlike those boring "to-do lists", this app is a Chuck Norris Meme Generator. **BUYA**!!! 🚀

The app uses two external API's:

* a [Chuck Norris jokes API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) 🔥
* and the [Unsplash pictures API,](https://unsplash.com/developers) 📷


which, together with **LocalStorage** (for storing the saved memes), DOM access and Responsive Design make for an app idea which is great if you're looking for something useful and fun! 😉
